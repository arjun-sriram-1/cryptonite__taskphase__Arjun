4)Grepping for a needle in a haystack
:the flag is hidden in a huge file, so the test containing pwn.college is grepped out by giving the below command to find the flag as the flag always starts with 'pwn.college'

5)Touching files
:we cd into the tmp folder and create two files pwn and college using the touch command and then use /challenge/run command to collect the flag

6)Removing files
:a file named delete_me is deleted using the rm command and the file name which is delete_me as the argument and /challenge/check is used to collect the flag
